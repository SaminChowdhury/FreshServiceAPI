# FreshServiceAPI
I used FreshService API, Python, and Bash to fetch data and create Grafana dashboards. Python API libraries fetched data while Bash automated extraction. Grafana API helped build informative dashboards, enhancing IT service management. Real-time monitoring and visualization were achieved for improved efficiency.
